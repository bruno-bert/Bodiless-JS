 * wrapper will not affect the hierarchy for subsequent HOC's *outside* the wrapper. For
 * example:
 * ```js
 * flowRight(
 *   ...
 *   withNodeKey('foo'), withNode,  // ...$foo
 *   withSidecarNodes(
 *     withNodeKey('bar'), withNode,  // ...$foo$bar
 *   ),
 *   withNodeKey('baz'); withNode, // ...$foo$baz (otherwise would be ...$foo$bar$baz)
 *   ...
 * )
 * ```
 * This is useful, for example, if you want to apply an enhancment HOC which uses its own
 * content node(s) without affecting the node paths of other children of the wrapped component.
 *
 * @param hocs A list of HOC's to be applied using the parallel node hierarchy.  These will
 *             be composed using lodash `flowRight`
 *
 * @return an HOC which can wrap any Component using the Bodiless `ContentNode` system.
